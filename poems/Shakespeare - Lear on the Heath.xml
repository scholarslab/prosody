                        you choose. But see whether, after you've completed scanning the speech, you
                        don't come around and agree with 4B4V that the meter of the passage is
                        pentameter -- as it is in nearly all Shakespeare's verse drama. An actor who
                        feels the pentameter supporting his performance of the speech may claim
                        license to linger out the last two words as if they were disyllables:
                        Rrrr-AGE! Bllll-OW! In this terrific scene old King Lear is, however you
                        take the word, quite mad.</note>

                    <note anchored="true"> The second foot of this line, as more obviously of the
                        one above it, exemplifies that 4B4V rarity, an embraced elision (chalk it up
                        as a pyrrhic victory). We choose elision here as the lesser of two evils,
                        the greater being a bathetic anapest that would mount through two slacks to
                        throw feeble pseudo-stress on a particle that couldn't really sustain the
                        weight. Try, nevertheless, to feel the elided third syllable in both
                        "sulphurous" and "courier" as a little rumble heralding the big spondaic
                        thunderclap that comes next as the maddened old king invokes the end of the
                        world. </note>

                        anapest, wobbly but still holding its ground, for the decisive reason that
                        "of" takes more stress than the ensuing "the." That's definitely not what
                        happens in lines 4 and 5 above. Alternatively, and although the 4B4V
                        operating system precludes its display as correct, you might put a light
                        stress on the last syllable of "rotundity" and gather "of the earth" up into
                        a last-foot (last-ditch?) anapest. The scansion may turn on whether your
                        Lear more relishes imagining the earth in its current roundness or as
                        flattened by the Last Judgment.</note>
