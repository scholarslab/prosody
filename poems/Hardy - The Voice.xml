                        three stanzas, keeps basic faith with the dactylic tetrameter but exhibits
                        double catalexis in the last foot (two slack syllables missing but implied,
                        leaving just the stressed syllable as a toe-hold). The ghostly presence of
                        these absent slackers is attested by the way a reader pauses at the end of
                        the line -- even when, as here, there's no retarding punctuation to insist
                        on it. The slowdown is more notable still in line 4, where the 3rd-foot
                        trochee marks time by stretching its one slack to cover the interval of the
                        expected two. </note>

                    <note anchored="true"> Let's hope this is the hardest line in all of 4B4V. The
                        temptation to abandon dactylic tetrameter here and head for the territories
                        is powerful; the key to resisting that temptation is the prosodist's shady
                        friend elision. By preference and also for programming reasons, 4B4V avoids
                        elision wherever possible, but here it's just not possible. A sloppy dactyl
                        can be made out of all those early syllables by means of two elisions:
                        "Ev'n" for "even," and "th' " for "the." These changes turn five syllables
                        into three and yield two feet: EV'n to th'or | IG in al. That leaves half a
                        line to go: a strongly syncopated but still legal spondee in the 3rd foot,
                        and a (by this point ordinary) terminally truncated catalectic 4th. Be proud
                        if you got this one even as soon as your third try; it has taken 4B4V that
                        long at least! Consider, finally, how a remarried old man's airbrushed
                        memory of his first wife, long estranged and since dead, might represent
                        something of a third try, too; also how the line bears up under the freight
                        of emotion and memory, its elided slack syllables hurrying up to the great
                        spondaic billow of the image at the end of the line. </note>

                    <note anchored="true"> Another surprise: Hardy changes his tune for the final
                        quatrain, reeling between trimeter and tetrameter, grasping at straws, and
                        leaving it up for grabs whether the prevailing meter in these last four
                        lines is still dactylic, as a conservative scansion might properly find, or
                        retrenches instead as 4B4V proposes to blunter trochaic. More important than
                        choosing between metrical options is sensing the complex rhythmic interplay
                        they enable, torn as the speaker is between talking himself out of the
                        belief that he's haunted and talking himself back into it. </note>

                        he must be imagining things; yet the "And" insists on the reality of what
                        stanzas 2 and 3 have imagined so loyally. It's just the wind. AND it's my dead
                        wife. </note>
