                        which has double catalexis (two slack syllables missing but implied). 4B4V,
                        however, hears at these line-ends a more substantial pause -- even though it
                        may go, as here, unpunctuated -- where the speaker's voice catches breath in
                        a way the iamb helps underscore. </note>

                    <note anchored="true"> This may be the hardest line in all of 4B4V: a line in
                        dactylic tetrameter that actually scans dactyl, anapest, anapest, spondee.
                        Be proud if you got this one even as early as your third try. You might
                        linger to think how a remarried old man's airbrushed memory of his first
                        wife, long estranged and since dead, might represent something of a third
                        try, too; also how the line bears up under the freight of emotion and
                        memory, its slack syllables hurrying up to the great spondaic billow of the
                        image at the end of the line. (See the note to line 10 below on
                        possibilities for elision here.) </note>

                    <note anchored="true">Another tricky line, whose scansion here is made easier if
                        you elide "Travelling" from 3 to 2 syllables ("Trav'ling"). That gives you
                        two falling feet (dactyl, trochee), in keeping with the overall tilt of the
                        poem's meter. It's also legal to try this expedient back in the
                        nerve-wracking line 8, by reading "Even" as "Ev'n" and/or "the original" as
                        "th'original"; but it doesn't really help much there, where Hardy is going
                        for broke and it seems wiser to let him be as strange as possible. Generally
                        4B4V eschews elision, but here in line 10 it's the right thing to do.</note>

                    <note anchored="true"> Another surprise: Hardy changes his tune for this final
                        quatrain, reeling between trimeter and tetrameter, grasping at straws, and
                        leaving it up for grabs whether the prevailing meter is still dactylic or,
                        as 4B4V more soberly judges, trochaic. More important than choosing between
                        the metrical options is sensing the complex rhythmic interplay they enable, torn
                        as the speaker is between talking himself out of the belief that he's
                        haunted and talking himself back into it. </note>

                    <note anchored="true"> "And" is a particle that almost never takes stress. Its
                        doing so here is eloquent: Hardy concedes, in the spirit of stanza 3, that
                        he must be imagining things; yet the "And" insists on the reality of what is
                        faithfully imagined. It's just the wind. AND it's my dead wife. </note>
