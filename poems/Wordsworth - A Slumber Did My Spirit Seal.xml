                Most readers scan this line without trouble.  What's odd is that they scan it different ways.  4B4V prefers to sit up and take notice at this early point in the poem, with a pyrrhic-spondee punch in the first two feet that registers the force of what the speaker knows now but didn't know back then.  The poem also reads very well -- but differently -- if you stick with the straight iambic meter here, in prolonged imitation of the blissful ignorance the speaker says here he used to enjoy. Neither is The Correct Scansion: each emphasizes a different emotional state, that's all -- and that's a lot.

                                                  <note anchored="true"> This is the most metrically
                                                  irregular line in the poem, and with good reason.
                                                  The spondaic substitution in the first foot
                                                  registers a change in rhythm which stands for a
                                                  change in perspective on the speaker's part. (Not
                                                  to mention the change in state for her who has
                                                  died!) And the difficulty of registering this
                                                  perspectival change gets reinforced in foot 4, as
                                                  if the speaker is forcing himself to believe in a
                                                  truth part of him still wants to deny. Readers may
                                                  also feel an ironic contrast with the only
                                                  previous departure from meter, again spondaic, in
                                                  the second foot of line 2 -- ironic, because at
                                                  that point what was being stressed was the false
                                                  security of that former state of denial. </note>

                        The thing to notice here is the weirdly serene regularity of the last line, corresponding to the organic, even inorganic pulse of the earth in which the deceased "She" is now buried.  It's an effect set in motion by the heavily alliterated "Rolled round" in line 7 (this iambic lyric's last, sojourning spondee), which heaves into motion a process whose laws enfold life as the grave enfolds the dead.
