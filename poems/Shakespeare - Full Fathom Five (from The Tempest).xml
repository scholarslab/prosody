                    <note anchored="true"> This line, like the next five after it, is acephalous.
                        (See Glossary.) Think of its singleton initial stress as the business end of
                        an iamb, whose partner is so slack that it hasn't even shown up for work.
                        Some prosodists represent the ghost syllable by a "(u)" in the margin, to
                        register the pause most of us feel -- like a quick intake of breath -- just
                        before the first voiced syllable. Acephalous lines are common in folk
                        poetry, art poetry that imitates the vernacular, and chants like this one
                        that have the force of a charm or spell. </note>

                        "nymphs" here doesn't take stress: "Sea nymphs" is a kind of two-noun
                        construction that English regularly stresses on the first noun only,
                        despite its actually adjectival function. Witness "sheet rock," "broom
                        straw," "bird dog," etc.</note>

                    <note anchored="true"> This resonant, unrhymed, onomatopoetic spondee is very
                        long: as long by the stopwatch, some might say, as any of the tetrameter
                        lines above it. If we took each line as a 4/4 musical measure, and counted
                        the syllables of the preceding tetrameter lines as eighth notes, each
                        syllable here in line 8 would be a half note. Of course composers of music
                        for this stage lyric can time it however they like. Good ones respect the
                        retard in the final line where "Ding-dong" comes back in fainter, swifter
                        echo. </note>
