                    <note anchored="true"> Everybody feels the sexiness of this line. Its creamy
                        iambs are sweeter still to an ear that has been hearing the meter of Blake's
                        song anapestically. (To scan it as iambic is to find more lines metrically
                        abnormal than normal, which seems like looking for trouble in a poem that is
                        already plenty strange.) Riding an anapestic meter, "crimson" tends to
                        ripple towards "ca-rimson," and the voiced "n" and "j" to feel a little like
                        vowels. </note>

                        <seg met="--+" real="+-+">se<sb/>cret <rhyme label="x">love</rhyme></seg>
                    <note anchored="true"> An admittedly vexing line. It won't quite do to scan
                        "secret love" as an anapest in conformity to the meter and claim, however
                        ingeniously, that the worm's secret is so well hidden that it flies under
                        the prosodic radar. For one thing, "secret" is a bona fide adjective
                        claiming proper stress for its accented on the first syllable. Then there's
                        its deep phonetic embroilment with the words just before it. Every
                        consonantal mouth-shape in "secret" is anticipated in "his dark." As a
                        result, "secret love" defies the rapid pronunciation that goes with an
                        anapestic line like line 3 from the first stanza. So what to do? Break the
                        rules, and call the second half of this line an amphimacer, a foot so exotic
                        ( / u / ) that we don't even put it in the 4B4V Glossary. </note>
