=======

This repository branch contains old files for the prosody website that are no longer maintained.

For more up-to-date (but similarly un-maintained) files, see the [WordPress theme](https://github.com/scholarslab/prosody_theme), and [WordPress plugin](https://github.com/scholarslab/prosody_plugin).

The master branch of this repository contains instructions and files for running the Prosody project in Docker on the production webserver or for development on your local machine.
